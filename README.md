# Automated PII Detection in Student Writing

This project is based on the Kaggle competition called [“The Learning Agency Lab – PII Data Detection”](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data/overview). It aims to develop robust automated techniques for detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing. By doing so, we address the critical need for safeguarding student privacy in educational datasets. We leverage advanced deep learning models, natural language processing techniques, and privacy-preserving methods to efficiently detect sensitive information while preserving the integrity and usefulness of the data. Techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), pattern matching, and LSTM/Transformer-like models will be explored and integrated to enhance PII
detection. Evaluation is be based on the micro F_β metric, with a focus on optimizing both recall and precision to achieve high-quality PII detection results. The value of β is be set to 5, which  makes the recall 5 times more heavily weighted than the precision.
